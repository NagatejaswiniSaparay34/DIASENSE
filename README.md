import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")

# Prepare data
X = df.drop("Outcome", axis=1)
y = df["Outcome"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
